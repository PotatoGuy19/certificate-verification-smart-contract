      <p>
        This web application allows you to upload your education certificate
        to a permanent, decentralized storage system called IPFS (Inter-Planetary
        File System). It then stores your signature on an Ethereum smart contract
        to verify the document's authenticity in the future. <br><br>

        Click "<b>Submit</b>" to send your certificate to decentralized storage.
        The application will return the certificate's IPFS address. Meanwhile,
        it will write a signature to Ethereum for you. <br><br>

        Click "<b>Verify</b>" to view your signature on the Ethereum blockchain. The
        application will tell you who is the issuer and the recipient as long as you
        present the correct IPFS hash address.
